We are three Master students at EPFL and this analysis was conducted as part of the <a href="https://dlab.epfl.ch/teaching/fall2017/cs401/" target="_blank">Applied Data Analysis</a> (ADA) course for Autumn Semester 2017.

For the project we chose to work on two databases (among the proposed ones): a large one, containing international tweets, as well as on a smaller one, containing Switzerland-based tweets. You can find more information about the datasets [here]().
